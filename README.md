### Creating an Article

#### Add Images to your article:

The optimum image size for google is 1200 x 700. This website [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com/) is a nice and quick way to get the right size for a picture and also make the image file size smaller. 

#### Embed from instagram & youtube:

[Read this,](https://scribehow.com/shared/How_to_Embed_an_Instagram_Post_in_a_Wordpress_Blog__Ns9fodS1SQ2X_zZr9P1NPA) for a step by step guide on embedding content in your article. Don't use the built in youtibe or instagram blocks as the formatting we have built into the site will not work properly with them.

#### Compititions:

[Read this,](https://scribehow.com/shared/How_to_Duplicate_and_Modify_a_Form_Template__cYn9WEeIRlK6O_P3jLP2sQ) for a walkthrough of how to create and then embed your competition in your article. It also documents how to check all the entries for when picking a winner. 

**PLEASE DON'T** click on any other forms than the competition and competition templates, we use this for registration to the site and any changes could mess up the sign up process and the salesforce integration. 

### Checking user numbers.

[Read this,](https://scribehow.com/shared/How_to_Filter_Entries_in_Fluent_Forms_Pro__gOjdil3cQyyMyjRztmecoQ) to see how to check signups for a given timeframe, again please do be careful to not edit the registration form.

### SEO & Rankmath:

Rank maths own [documentation here](https://rankmath.com/kb/score-100-in-tests/) is very thorough. You can also see in the plug in sidebar links to the relevant parts from this article. 

Keywords are hugely important in SEO, making sure they are used in the title and checking to see if they are trending or relevant through [google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) can make a huge difference.
